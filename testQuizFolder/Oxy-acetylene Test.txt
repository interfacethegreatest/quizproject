F* The correct breathing aparatus are canister _, also known as self contained _ apparatus, as well as local _.*respirator-breathing-extraction
M* Which fuel source should you use to spark the torch? *A Butane lighter-B Spark gun*B
F* Correct handling of gas cylinders involves storing in a well-ventilated area, with flame proof _ fittings, no smoking, no greasy _ and no exposed _ in the storage area.*electrical-clothing-flames
F* It is important to protect cylinders from snow ice and from the _ if stored outside*Sun
M* Should you regularly apply lubrication, jointing compounds? *A yes-B No*B
F* Acetylene cylinders should be stored in an upright position at all times as well as being _ in an appropriate _ when moving.*secured-trolley
F* Snifting involves quickly blowing out gas before fitting the _ to ensure there is no dirt or _ entering the _. One gas which should not be snifted is _.*regulator-grease-hydrogen
M* If an acetylene canister becomes heated you should spray it with water, inform the fire brigade and cordon off the area*A true-B false*A
M* Cylinders must be kept clear of moving materials*A true-B False
F* Leather goods are extremely important to be worn for personal safety as they have self-_ qualities.*extinguishing

F* The gas which is given off when degreasers are heated is known as _ gas.*mustard
F* combustible gasses all have different positioned valve sockets or threads on their gas cylinders. These threads are positioned to the _ hand which non-combustible canisters have threads positioned to the _ hand. These are denoted by different _.*Left
F* All cylinders are turned _ to _ and anticlockwise to _.*clockwise-open-close
F* A reugulator ensures that pressures inside the canister are reduced to safe working pressures over a range of flow-rates and _.
M* Where are flashback arrestors required by law to be fitted?*A pressure hose-B Canister thread-C Regulator-D Torch*C
F* The welding torch consists of a shank which incorporates the _ and _; A control valve, regulating the flow rate of gasses and a mixer / injector, mixing gasses and a range of copper nozzles. The copper nozles primarily look to regulate the _ supplied to the weld as well as the _ of the flame.*oxygen-acetylene-heat-direction
