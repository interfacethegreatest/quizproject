F* Orthographic projection: *This is conveyed the conventional way of drawing _, within this projection of drawing, _ _ and _ angle.*components-first-angle-third
F* First angle (Orthographic projection): *Often referred to as the _ representation in which the drawing is presented with a _ pattern. The _ elevation is laid out first at the top of the paper, with _ views either side and a _ view immediately below the front.*imperial-front-end-plan
F* Third angle (Orthographic projection): *Often reffered to as the _ representation, is laid out with the _ immediately above the _. *american-plan-front
M* Production drawings are classified in two major categories*A true-B false*A
F* Assembly drawings : *These show how parts _ _ or are functionally related*fit-toghether
F* Circuit Wiring Diagrams: *A wiring digram is a simplified conventional pictorial representation of an _  ciruit. It shows the _ of the circuit as simplified shapes, and the power and signal connections between devices. A pictoral diagram would show more detail of the _ appearance, while a wiring diagram a more _ notation.*electrical-components-physical-symbolic
F* Pictorial Projection: *One drawing will show three views and within this group, once again two distinct versions exist _ and _ projection. In isometric projection the view is built around _ planes. In Oblique projection the view is built along _.*isometric-oblique-three-two
F* Engineering Detail Layout: *Engineering drawing starts with selecting the correct _ of paper on which to design the component. Having selected the _, it is standard practice to construct a _ and a block tile to house specific detail relative to the _. Typical information includes; -Name of draughtsman -_ of issue-Scale-Projection-Material _-Surface finish*size-size-border-component-composition
F* In engineering: *To create a compositional _, we must also recognise the type of line we should use: -Part outlines identify _ lines.-Section lines identify light lines.-Hidden lines identify medium broken up lines. Center lines identify _, broken lines.-_ and Extension lines identify light solid lines with measurements.-_ Lines represent Heavy and light lines with jagged notation.*design-heavy-light-dimension-break
F* Conventional Representation: * Conventional representation of common features is often used to cut unnecessary _ out of a drawing, saving time and helping to keep the drawing _.*detail-clear
F* Hacksaws : * The blade has a large number of _ and once again the _ and _ angles are used. Always however the slot to be cut is slightly _ than the blade thickness, this prevents jamming during use*teeth-rake-clearance-wider
F* Sectional Views: *Whist some detail can be shown on a drawing, more precise detail must be indicated as if a component were cut. First, the drawing must indicate which face is being viewed. This is done by placing _ at extreme ends of the line which represents the imaginary cut. However if the views of the detail being shown are identical in both _ the arrows may be omitted.*arrows-directions
F* Dimensioning and Tolerances: * It tells the manufacturing staff and machines what degree of accuracy and precision is needed of each facet or part. Dimensioning specifications define as-intended geometry. One example is a basic dimension. Tolerance specifications define the allowable _ for the form and possibly the size of induvidual features. Examples include linear dimensions and feature control frames using a _ reference.*variation-datum
F* Vices : *Available for a wide range of applications, but in all cases should only be tightened with sufficient force to _ movement. Over tightening a vice will distort or _ the work peice or lead to the vice itself being damaged. *restrict-damage
F* Rake and clearance angles: *Back rake is designed to control the direction in which a chip is sent. Side rake along with back rake controls the _ flow. It partly counteracts resistance to the movement of the cutter and can be set to suit the particular materical being cut. Clearance angles are designed to ensure rapid clearance of material and ensure no part of the tool beside the cutting edge can touch the work.*chip
F* Non-chip forming processes : * Guillotines, hand-shears, portable shears -Snips-Punching tools-cropping machines- These operate on the premise that initial impact causes the material to be cut because there is a fixed blade and a moving blade and serverance occurs because the moving blade has designated _.*clearance
F* Emergent problem sequence: *The real problem must be determined. Beware erroneuous data. A case of this type where there may be more than one problem is a _ problem or in systems terminology a '_'.*compound-mess
F* Adhesion can occur in two ways: *A Mechanical interlocking : where adhesives penetrate the pores of the adherands and produces physical cementing. -B specific bonding: where adherents react chemically bonding them through inter-molecular _.-C Cohesion which is the ability of the adhesive to withstand forces within itself without failure.*attraction
F* Types of adhesives: *Thermo-plastic, adhesives which soften when cooled, the cycle being _.-Thermo setting, adhesives which are set to a permanent shape. They need heating and pressure and will not re-_.*repeated-soften
F* Paralax Error : * Parallax error is the result of any sideways positioning of the direction of sighting. It is therefore important to ensure that the eye is at 90 degrees to the work surface in order to get a _ reading.*true
F * Rectangular coordinates: *These are coordinates in which dimensions are at _ angles to one another.*right
F* Polar coordinates: *Where a dimension is measured in a radial line from the _.*datum
F* Chain and progressive dimensioning: * Chain dimensioning is where each dimension is taken from the previous dimension and this can result in cumulative _, where discrepancies in one dimension are magnified along the plate. Progressive dimensioning is where dimensions are taken from a 'known' _. If there is a discrepancy it will only impact on that particular dimension, increasing accuracy overall. *error-datum
