F* First angle (Orthographic projection): *Often referred to as the _ representation in which the drawing is presented with a _ pattern. The _ elevation is laid out first at the top of the paper, with _ views either side and a _ view immediately below the front.*imperial-front-end-plan
F* Third angle (Orthographic projection): *Often reffered to as the _ representation, is laid out with the _ immediately above the _. *american-plan-front
M* Production drawings are classified in two major categories*A true-B false*A
F* Assembly drawings : *These show how parts _ _ or are functionally related*fit-toghether
F* Circuit Wiring Diagrams: *A wiring digram is a simplified conventional pictorial representation of an _  ciruit. It shows the _ of the circuit as simplified shapes, and the power and signal connections between devices. A pictoral diagram would show more detail of the _ appearance, while a wiring diagram a more _ notation.*electrical-components-physical-symbolic
F* Pictorial Projection: *One drawing will show three views and within this group, once again two distinct versions exist _ and _ projection. In isometric projection the view is built around _ planes. In Oblique projection the view is built along _.*isometric-oblique-three-two
F* Engineering Detail Layout: *Engineering drawing starts with selecting the correct _ of paper on which to design the component. Having selected the _, it is standard practice to construct a _ and a block tile to house specific detail relative to the _.

F* In engineering: *To create a compositional d_, we must also recognise the type of line we should use: -_ outlines identify _ lines.-_ outlines identify light lines.-_ lines identify medium broken up lines. _ lines identify light, broken lines.-_ and Extension lines identify light solid lines with measurements.-_ Lines represent Heavy and light lines with jagged notation.*design-part-section-hidden-center
