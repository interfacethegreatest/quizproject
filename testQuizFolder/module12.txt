F*Oxy-Acetylene storage: *Ensure cynlinders are stored in a well-ventilated area, preferably in the open air. Ensure cylinders are stored _ and segregated by type, with approximately _ metres distance between fuel and oxygen.*upright-three/3
F* Oxy-Acetylene storage: *Keep cylinders away from high _ electrical equipment to prevent stray _. * current-arcing
F* Oxy-acetylene storage: * Purging of gasses should not be carried out in confined spaces. Matches or lighters should not be used to ignite the flame. Oxygen can react violently with lubricating oils or _. *grease
F* Oxy-acetylene storage: * Never use fittings containing more than 70% _ as this could create a explosive compounds*Copper
F* Transportation of Gas cylinders* Ensure if cylinders must be stored sideways, journeys are fast and the cylinders must be secured upright and allow _ hours to ensure acetone is back in solution. Never carry toxic cylinders (yellow) in a closed van.*12/twelve
F* Oxy-fuel Gas cutting: * in oxy fuel cutting, the formation of oxygen becommes rapid and combustion or burning takes place. The rapid rise in temperature generated by oxidation burns through metal, creating magnetic molten iron removed by the oxygen stream.
F* Oxy-fuel Gas cutting: *elements in steel such as carbon and sulphur can form gases which are generated at the interface between the cutting oxygen and the steel. These are carbon _ and carbon _ which must be swept away by the velocity of the oxygen jet or they will act as a _ preventing oxygen from coming into contact with hot steel. *monoxide-dioxide-barrier
F* Manifold systems: * Where the total required discharge rate of an acetylene cylinder would be above the maximum safe rate of _m cylinders must be joined toghether with a manifold. This method consists of interconnecting two or more cylinders to supply a common outlet.*20%/twenty/twenty percent
